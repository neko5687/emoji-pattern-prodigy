  <h1 class="title">What is algorithmic thinking?</h1>
  <div>
    <p class="block-text">
      Algorithmic thinking is a problem-solving method that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller,
      more manageable parts, and then developing a step-by-step solution for each part. It involves identifying
      patterns and applying logical reasoning to find the most efficient and effective solution to a given problem.
      <br><br>

      Algorithmic thinking is particularly important in computer science, as it is the basis for developing computer
      algorithms that can perform tasks efficiently and reliably. However, it can also be applied to other fields,
      such as mathematics, engineering, and business, to help solve complex problems and make decisions based on data.
      <br><br>

      The key steps involved in algorithmic thinking include identifying the problem, defining the inputs and outputs,
      breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, designing and testing potential solutions, and refining
      and improving the solution until it is optimal. <br><br>

      <span class="bold-colorful">Developing algorithmic thinking skills can help individuals become better problem solvers, critical thinkers,
      and decision makers, and can be useful in a wide range of personal and professional contexts.</span><br><br>
